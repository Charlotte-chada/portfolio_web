#st.subheader(" Conclusions")
#st.write("After loading the raw data, all data issues, including missing values, impossible values, and data entry issues were detected and removed. Then, the final data frame was analysis including 1) Admission grade distribution, 2) number of students categorised by target, 3) average Age at Enrolment of Marital Status, 4) Percentage of Dropout Student Based on Course,5) Average of Curricular units 1st sem Grade in Each Course Based on Scholarship Holder, and 6) Scatter matrix. From the analysis, it provides some insight, such as the center of admission grades is near 120-130, Corse number 33 has the highest percentage of dropout students up to 67%, students in almost all classes who hold the scholarship have a higher average grade in 1st semester compared to the other student group, and Admission grade and Previous qualification (grade) provide a moderate correlation as a linear in the same direction according to it reflecting the student’s academic qualification.")
