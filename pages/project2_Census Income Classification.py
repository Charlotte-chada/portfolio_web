st.write("The selected dataset for this project is 'Census Income' from the UCI repository to predict the class to predict whether income exceeds $50K/year. The dataset underwent data preparation, data exploration, data encoding, and data modelling in Task 1, Task 2, and Task 3, respectively, using the Python programming language. The outcome of the analysis is two classification models which are Random Forest and Decision Tree for predicting the income class. Furthermore, the outcome from two models was evaluated and compared with the relevant metrics such as accuracy, precision, F-1 score, and recall, these parameters were reported in terms of numerical data al also plotted as visualisation. Based on the outcome and model comparison, it is evident that the Decision Tree model outperforms the other models.")
